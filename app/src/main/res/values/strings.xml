    <string name="about">Hello Dragon!!! A popup menu displays a list of items in a vertical list that\'s anchored to the view that invoked the menu. It\'s good for providing an overflow of actions that relate to specific content or to provide options for a second part of a command. Actions in a popup menu should not directly affect the corresponding contentâ€”that\'s what contextual actions are for. Rather, the popup menu is for extended actions that relate to regions of content in your activity.</string>
